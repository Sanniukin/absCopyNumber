Description: Estimate tumor purity, ploidy and absolute copy numbers from NGS (WGS, WES, Target Sequencing) 
             and Microarray (SNP, aCGH etc.) data, based on statistical method from paper 
             "AbsCN-seq: a statistical method to estimate tumor purity, ploidy and absolute copy numbers 
             from next-generation sequencing data".
