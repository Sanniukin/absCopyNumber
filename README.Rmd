# absCopyNumber

The goal of absCopyNumber is to ...

## Installation

You can install absCopyNumber from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ShixiangWang/absCopyNumber")
```

## Input

http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/modules/docs/ABSOLUTE/2

```
1. Input copy ratio file ("example.cn.txt")

The input copy ratio file contains segmented copy ratio data, which can be generated by popular segmentation algorithms like 
the "DNAcopy" R package.
It should be a tab-delimited text file with five columns.  
Please use the EXACT header names as below.
1) "chrom"
The chromosome number of a segment. Must be a integer number from 1 to 22.
2) "loc.start"
The start position of a segment.
3) "loc.end"
The end position of a segment.
4) "eff.seg.len"
For exome sequencing, due to the nature of highly uneven coverage (zero coverage for introns), this column gives the number of base pairs with actual observed coverage. 
It can be derived by concatenate all the VARSCAN bins within a segment. 
Note that this length is usually much smaller than the length of the segment which is loc.end-loc.start+1	
5) "normalized.ratio"
The mean copy ratio (tumor DNA vs. germline DNA) of a segment. 
Note that the copy ratio should be normalized to eliminate any sequencing throughput difference between tumor and germline DNA. 
For example, samtools can be used to count total reads that were properly paired/aligned for tumor and germline DNA. 
The difference then need to be adjusted accordingly.  


2. Input SNV file ("example.snv.txt")

The input SNV file contains allele frequency data for somatic mutations.
It should be a tab-delimited text file with three columns.
Please use the EXACT header names as below.
1) "chrom"
The chromosome number of a somatic SNV. Must be a integer number from 1 to 22.
2) "position"
The genomic position of a somatic SNV.
3) "tumor_var_freq"
The proportion of reads supporting the somatic SNV allele. Must be a fraction number. 
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
